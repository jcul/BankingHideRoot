Xposed Framework module to hide root from some banking apps in the UK

Wrote this module so I could use my bank's application on my rooted android.

Licensed under gpl v3 (see LICENSE file).

It comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind, use at your own risk.

At the moment it seems to work with the version of the application I have, which is 5.1.

It's likely to stop working if the application is updated.

Note: This is not a rooted version of any banking app, it is a module for the Xposed Framework to hide root from the banking apps.
